# Aerodynamic-Lab

Aerodynamic Laboratory:

Lab\_1: contains the code for validating Task 1 and Task 2.

--> Task1\_Task2: Implementation of the Hess-Smith method and the Thin Airfoil Theory and comparison with Xfoil program of Cp, Cl, Cm and error; Data gathering and preliminary study for task 2 using Xfoil's outputs.

--> Task2\_Boundary\_Layer\_Analysis: In depth analysis of the boundary layer with transition from laminar to turbulent and separation alongside the airfoil's chord.



Lab\_2: contains the code for validating Task 3 and Task 4.

--> Task3: Code for the implementation of the Weissinger method. The two implementations are located in two different folders: Original Weissinger and Modified Weissinger. Each folder contains Comparison.m and Iterative\_Weissinger.m.
To see the impementation of Weissinger, run Iterative\_Weissinger.m. To see the comparison between Weissinger and XFLR5, run Comparison.m.

--> Task 4: Code for the comparison of two aircraft. Run Task4.m to see the results. The first 5 graphs are related to the Cessna 172, while the next 5 are related to the Rutan Long-EZ. The remaining plots compare the induced angles and the      polar (CL-CDi) graph of the planes.
